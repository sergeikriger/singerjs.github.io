I'm Yours
Jason Mraz

     A
Well you done done me and you bet I felt it
  E
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
  F#m                                        D
I fell right through the cracks, and now I'm tryin' to get back...
           A
Before the cool done run out I'll be giving it my bestest
    E
And nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
  F#m                          D
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some

Chorus:
	  A           E                F#m
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
          D                    A         
It cannot wait, I'm yo-o-o-o-o-ours


Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love
Listen to the music of the moment people, dance and sing
We're just one big family
                                                            H7
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved loved love love love


Chorus: 
So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm sure
There's no need to complicate, our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yo-o-o-o-o-ours


I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed

I guess what I be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do, our name is our virtue


Chorus:
So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm sure
There's no need to complicate, our time is short
                                 H7
This is our fate, I'm yo-o-o-o-o-ours
