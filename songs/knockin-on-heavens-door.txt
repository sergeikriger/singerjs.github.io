Knockin On Heavens Door
Bob Dylan

G                D          Am
  Mama take this badge from me
G         D         C
  I can't use it anymore
G              D                Am
  It's getting dark too dark to see
G            D                        C
  Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door


Chorus:
G             D                    Am
  Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
G             D                    C
  Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
G             D                    Am
  Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
G             D                    C
  Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door


Mama put my guns in the ground
I can't shoot them anymore
That cold black cloud is comin' down
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door

Chorus:
