Imagine
John Lennon

C                    Fmaj7
  Imagine there's no heaven
C                  Fmaj7
  It's easy if you try
C           Fmaj7
  No hell below us
C               Fmaj7
  Above us only sky
F         Am7     Dm      Dm/C
  Imagine all the people
G
Living for today...


Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace...

Chorus:
F         G         C        E
  You may say I'm a dreamer
F         G            C    E
  But I'm not the only one
F            G          C        E
  I hope someday you'll join us
F         G                C
  And the world will be as one


Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world...

Chorus:
