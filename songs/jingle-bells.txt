Jingle bells
James Lord Pierpont 

A
Dashing through the snow
     D
In a one-horse open sleigh
                  E
O'er the hills we go
                 A
Laughing all the way.


Bells on bobtail ring
               D
Making spirits bright
                  A
What fun it is to ride and sing
  E                A      E
A sleighing song tonight.


Chorus:
A
Jingle bells, jingle bells

Jingle all the way!
D             A
O what fun it is to ride
     H7             E
In a one-horse open sleigh.

A
Jingle bells, jingle bells

Jingle all the way!
D             A
O what fun it is to ride
     E              A
In a one-horse open sleigh.


A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fannie Bright
Was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
He got into a drifted bank
And we - we got upset

Chorus:

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song
Just get a bobtailed bay
Two forty is his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! You'll take the lead.

Chorus:
